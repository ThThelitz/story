    <p>
        Study Recommendation™: if you have to write a digital narrative for a course, plan ahead and don't leave too much work for the final days. This way you'll have time to come up with proper room descriptions (if you, hypothetically, write a narrative that involves a lot of those) instead of silly self-referential material.
