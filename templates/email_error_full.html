    </h6>
    <p>
        Dear exchange student
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, your department has rejected some of the module choices you have indicated:
        <ul id="full-modules"></ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please have another look at the module list and send us another selection which we will process within the next two months or so.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luckily, we are able to book modules for you digitally via e-mail, but for reasons lost to time, you must send an email with your choices, and then we send one back which informs you which ones are actually eligible for you to choose. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You might think "that seems needlessly overcomplicated, why wouldn't you just tell me what I can book?
    </p>
    <p>
        What you don't know is that we are slaves to an ancient curse which dictates that no bureaucratic action may be done in a simple way. We are powerless against this curse, please send help.
    </p>
    <p>
        But also, please send us another list of module choices.
    </p>
