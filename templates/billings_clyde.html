        "It's a bit of a longer way from th others, but this is Billings-Clyde. The Dark Arts Department is located in this building, but it used to be home to the Finance and Banking Department."

        Actually, that reminds me! If you have any courses that say they take place in the Sigourneth Building, you can safely ignore that. The Fartrell Building is where you actually need to go. Dark Arts used to be in Fartrell, and when they moved out, Unholy Rituals moved over to there from Sigourneth. Or at least I think so, I'm actually an Alchemy student.

        Anyways, lots of students get lost in the first days, just make sure to go to the right building. Let's go back to the <a href="/52">park</a> now.
